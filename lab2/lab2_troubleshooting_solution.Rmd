Load packages

```{r}
library(MplusAutomation)
library(tidyverse) #collection of R packages designed for data science
library(here) #helps with filepaths
library(janitor) #clean_names
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The data can be found in the `data` folder and is called `lsay_subset.csv`.

```{r}
lsay_data <- read_csv(here("lab1","data","lsay_subset.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() # make variable names lowercase

# Quick data summary
summary(lsay_data)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Without looking at lab 1, get this code to run by identifying the errors in syntax. Successful completion of lab occurs when youâ€™re able to run the analyses! 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
input  <- mplusObject(
  TITLE = "LSAY - Lab 2", # >90 characters 
  VARIABLE = "categorical = enjoy useful logical job adult; ! missing semicolon
  usevar =  enjoy useful logical job adult;
  classes = c(4);",
  
  ANALYSIS = 
   "estimator = mlr; 
    type = mixture;",
  
  OUTPUT = "tech11 tech14;", # Space between tech and 11
  
  PLOT = "type = plot3; 
    series = enjoy-adult(*);",
  
  usevariables = colnames(lsay_data), # wrong data name
  rdata = lsay_data)

output <- mplusModeler(input,
                       dataout=here("lab2", "mplus", "lsay.dat"), # wrong folder name
                       modelout=here("lab2", "mplus","lsay.inp") ,
                       check=TRUE, run = TRUE, hashfilename = FALSE)
```

### Output

When looking at our output for this example, there is a warning message presented:

     IN THE OPTIMIZATION, ONE OR MORE LOGIT THRESHOLDS APPROACHED EXTREME VALUES
     OF -15.000 AND 15.000 AND WERE FIXED TO STABILIZE MODEL ESTIMATION.  THESE
     VALUES IMPLY PROBABILITIES OF 0 AND 1.  IN THE MODEL RESULTS SECTION, THESE
     PARAMETERS HAVE 0 STANDARD ERRORS AND 999 IN THE Z-SCORE AND P-VALUE COLUMNS.
     
What does this message mean?

It is telling you that for some classes a latent class indicator has a probability of zero or one.
