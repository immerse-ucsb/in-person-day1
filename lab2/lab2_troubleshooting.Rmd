Data source: Longitudinal Study of American Life.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
tribble(
  ~"Name", ~"Description", 
  #----------|-------------|,
  "Enjoy", "I Enjoy Science",
  "Useful", "Science is Useful in Everyday Problems",
  "Logical", "Science Helps Logical Thinking",
  "Job", "Need Science for a Good Job" ,
  "Adult", "Will Use Science Often as an Adult") %>%

    title = "Binary LCA indicators"  # Add a title
  ) %>%

  ) %>%

The data can be found in the `data` folder and is called `lsay_subset.csv`.

```{r}
lsay_data <- read_csv(here("lab1","data","lsay_subset.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() # make variable names lowercase

# Quick data summary
summary(lsay_data)
```

## Troubleshooting

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Input

Without looking at lab 1, get this code to run by identifying the errors in syntax.
Successful completion of lab occurs when you're able to run the analyses!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
input  <- mplusObject(
  TITLE = "This is an example for a two-class mixture model, please go through the input file and fix any problems that you see.", 
  VARIABLE = "categorical = enjoy useful logical job adult
  usevar =  enjoy useful logical job adult;
  classes = c(4);",
  
  ANALYSIS = 
   "estimator = mlr; 
    type = mixture;",
  
  OUTPUT = "tech 11 tech14",
  
  PLOT = "type = plot3; 
    series = enjoy-adult(*);",
  
  usevariables = colnames(data),
  rdata = data)

output <- mplusModeler(input,
                       dataout=here("lab2", "mplus_folder", "lsay.dat"),
                       modelout=here("lab2", "mplus_folder","lsay.inp") ,
                       check=TRUE, run = TRUE, hashfilename = FALSE)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Output

When looking at our output for this example, there is a warning message presented:

```         
 IN THE OPTIMIZATION, ONE OR MORE LOGIT THRESHOLDS APPROACHED EXTREME VALUES
 OF -15.000 AND 15.000 AND WERE FIXED TO STABILIZE MODEL ESTIMATION.  THESE
 VALUES IMPLY PROBABILITIES OF 0 AND 1.  IN THE MODEL RESULTS SECTION, THESE
 PARAMETERS HAVE 0 STANDARD ERRORS AND 999 IN THE Z-SCORE AND P-VALUE COLUMNS.
```

What does this message mean?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples of messages that should not be ignored and may indicate unreliable output:

```
WARNING: THE BEST LOGLIKELIHOOD VALUE WAS NOT REPLICATED. THE
SOLUTION MAY NOT BE TRUSTWORTHY DUE TO LOCAL MAXIMA. INCREASE THE
NUMBER OF RANDOM STARTS.
```

```
ONE OR MORE PARAMETERS WERE FIXED TO AVOID SINGULARITY OF THE
INFORMATION MATRIX. THE SINGULARITY IS MOST LIKELY BECAUSE THE
MODEL IS NOT IDENTIFIED, OR BECAUSE OF EMPTY CELLS IN THE JOINT
DISTRIBUTION OF THE CATEGORICAL VARIABLES IN THE MODEL.
THE FOLLOWING PARAMETERS WERE FIXED:
Parameter 3, %C#1%: [ LOGICAL\$1 ]
```

```
THE DEGREES OF FREEDOM FOR THIS MODEL ARE NEGATIVE. THE MODEL IS NOT
IDENTIFIED OR TOO MANY CELLS WERE DELETED. A CHI-SQUARE TEST IS NOT
AVAILABLE.
```
